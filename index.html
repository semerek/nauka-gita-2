      Bohemian Rhapsody
      <h4>by Freddie Mercury</h4>
    </header>
    <p>Mama, just killed a man
    <br>Put a gun against his head
    <br>Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
    <br>Mama, life had just begun
    <br>But now I've gone and thrown it all away
    <br>Mama, ooh
    <br>Didn't mean to make you cry
    <br>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
    <br>Carry on, carry on
    <br>As if nothing really matters
    <br>Too late, my time has come
    <br>Sends shivers down my spine
    <br>Body's aching all the time
    <br>Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
    <br>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
    <br>Mama, ooh
    <br>I don't want to die
    <br>I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all</p>
